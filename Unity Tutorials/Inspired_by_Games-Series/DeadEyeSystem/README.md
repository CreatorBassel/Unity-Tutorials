<h1>Unity | Dead Eye - Red Dead Redemption 2 (Inspired by Games)</h1>
<p>This is the second tutorial in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LofJMnWPClo&list=PLaqp5z-4pFi5auiUbsq_KChZKX-DufAOI">series (<b>Inspired by Games</b>)</a>. In this tutorial, we copy the Dead Eye System from <b>Red Dead Redemption 2</b> in a simple way.</p>
<p>This series is to inspire all game developers to get ideas from other games and think creatively how to copy the feature but in their own and with their own touch on it.</p>
<p>You can find the <b>Unity</b> package for the whole project, but if you don't want to download it, get the script directly from the <i>scripts</i> folder.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the series by going to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LofJMnWPClo&list=PLaqp5z-4pFi5auiUbsq_KChZKX-DufAOI">YouTube Playlist</a>.</p>
