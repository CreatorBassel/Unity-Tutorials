* Unity | Dead Eye - Red Dead Redemption (Inspired by Games)
*
* This is the second episode of the new series: Inspired by Games
* Where we will choose a feature from our favorite games
* and try to copy it and learn the science behind it
*
* Full tutorial available at:

/*
* How to use:
* 1- Attach this script to the camera
* 2- Create multiple UI Crosses (the "x" target ui) and assign them to the "cross" variable
* 3- Change the "CameraLook" to your camera look script, in this case it is CameraLook, if you're using it then leave it as it is.
*    Then assign the camera script to it.
* 4- Create a PostProcessingLayer and PostProcessingVolume then assign the volume to the "ppv" variable.
* 5- Add an AudioSource component and assign the gun shot sound, you can find it in "SFX" folder or you can use your own.
*    Assign it to "shot_sfx" variable.
